# pastard.py
Pastebin client of the future - today!

You can either choose a file to upload, or enter some text 
yourself. You can even name your paste!

Please keep in mind that this is an early beta and some 
features you might find essential could be missing.

## Options
There are plenty of options. I'll list them here for you.

'-f' selects a file to upload.
'-t' gives your paste a nice name.

For example,

python pastard.py -f text.txt -t Text

would create a paste called "Text", with contents of your 
"text.txt" file. You can combine these options any way you 
like, be creative etc.

For questions, suggestions or whatever you can think of to 
say about a script like this, you can send electronic mail 
to bataille (at) riseup (dot) net.

Happy pastin'!
